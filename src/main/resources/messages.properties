home.aboutText=I turn simple fabrics into one-of-a-kind garments that feel as good as they look.\nInspired by vintage silhouettes and modern ease, I handcraft each piece in my cozy home studio in IaÈ™i.\nWhen Iâ€™m not at my sewing machine, Iâ€™m sketching new ideas, sourcing beautiful natural fibers, or sharing styling tips over coffee with friends.
